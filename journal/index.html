                <p>Game design is like a science that involves user psychology and practicing user empathy.  It makes game designers put themselves in the shoes of their users, and the challenge is to anticipate what actions the users will take in the game.  </p>

                <p>I really like the section about strategic UI positions that lead to monetization. I thought it was interesting how it was a tactic to place interactive monetization buttons in areas that are comfortable to reach, such as the corners. I also thought it was interesting how mistakes were taken into account for, as ways that can maximize revenue. The article also provided a lot of important tips, such as placing user decisions that are good for your game on the right and user decisions that are bad for your game on the left.  </p> 

                <p>
                Reflecting on my own experiences playing mobile games, I have realized that interacting with mobile games feels quite intuitive.  An effective mobile game guides users through a series of steps without requiring much attention to written instructions.  This is an important factor to consider when designing a game in general.</p>

            <figure id="photo">
                <img src="images/dogBox.jpg" alt="dog box" style="width:40%">
                <figcaption>Fig.1 - Kellie Lu, 2024.</figcaption>
            </figure>


            <div class = "entry">
                <p>This particular photo I chose is self-explanatory about what it captures. However, it is essential because it provides some context on the theme of the project. I want to reinforce that all the items drawn are from a mystery box in which I had no control over which version of the item I got.  The angle I captured the photo reflects the element of mystery as well, as the viewer is only able to see part of the box.</p>

                <p> My collection of blind box trinkets show that I am a person who appreciates small details and items that have personality and uniqueness.  It also showcases my niche hobby that I enjoy.  All my items are displayed on my desk as decorations and prompts for storytelling.  I enjoy drawing the blind box trinkets because of the feeling of anticipation and mystery behind unveiling the items.  I think this the action of drawing mystery box items is a really fun experience unique to anyone since everything is random!</p>
            </div>


            <figure id="photo">
                <img src="images/roomdrawing.jpg" alt="room drawing" style="width:40%">
                <figcaption>Fig.2 - Isabella Intersimone, 2024.</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <div class="entry">
                <p>Based on Isabella's drawing, I can infer that she is an observant individual who values living in the moment.  From her sketch, I can assume that she enjoys capturing moments in her life from different perspectives, almost like her own form of photojournalism (but through quick sketches). </p>

                <p>Looking at her sketch, I noticed that she records the date and place of her sketch.  This demonstrates how detail-oriented she is and how she makes light of smaller daily moments in life through her sketches.  I think is such a unique hobby since it is a wonderful way to look back on old memories and recall small moments in time in which the viewer is transported to a specific time and place!</p>

            <h2>Journal Entry 3: Visual Thinking Strategies Research</h2>

                <p>The key to an engaging photo is detail that stimulates people to think about the photo’s intention.  In the article “10 Intriguing Photos to Teach Close Reading and Visual Thinking Skills,” Gonchar writes about ideas from students and teachers who have practiced visual thinking skills from looking at pictures.  Ideas include being detectives, practicing regularly, asking open ended questions, noticing details, building on others’ observations, adapting questions for all subjects, expanding worldly knowledge, starting conversations, introducing new ideas, and experimenting with ways to look closely.</p>

                <p>The key takeaway is that photos should make viewers question what was the message of the photo. I also believe that photos that stimulate feelings in the viewers are what make photos memorable and special.</p>

                <p>One website I found that looked particularly interesting was OTOFILM by we3studio.  The production studio’s website features a homepage full of cinematic advertisement campaign videos for different brands.  The website features a scroll and expand function where the viewer sees part of an image and can click and expand into the image.  Each time the user scrolls, you get introduced to a new topic.  I found this website to be very engaging and quite beautiful to scroll through.  All the elements are so cleverly placed, and I like how the text smoothly transitions from one idea into the next.</p>

                <div id="photo">
                    <img src="images/modal.jpg" id="computer forms" alt="modals" width="680">

                <div class = "entry">
                    <p>Utilizing modals, overlays, and dialogue windows in a user interface is a science that must be perfected to satisfy its intended purpose. Modals are effective choices for grabbing the user’s attention, requesting user input such as signing in or logging in, showing additional contextual information, and showing additional non-contextual information.
                    </p>

                    <p>I thought it was interesting how the article talked about how modals can both help and hurt its intended purpose depending on how well they are designed to be executed. 
                    </p>

                    <p>One valuable practice that I read was that pop-ups should always be user-initiated, meaning the user should be the one who controls or triggers the response.  Pop-ups that suddenly appear can cause stress and result in the user quickly dismissing it.  Another valuable practice is that it is important to have an “escape hatch” that allows the user to exit out of the pop-up as well as buttons with understandable names that indicate action items.  
                    </p>

                    <p>I think that these design choices all fall in line with the theme that it is important that the users feel like they are in control at all times. Designing effective modals requires further thought about how users will respond to them. This requires skill in developing user empathy.

                <h2>Journal Entry 1: Best Practices for Form Design</h2>
                <time datetime="2024-1-24">January 24, 2024</time>

                <div id="photo">
                    <img src="images/computerForm.png" id="computer forms" alt="computer forms" width="680">

                <div class="entry">
                    <p>UX has the ability to affect the overall usability of a form.  I realize that filling out forms can often be quite draining and make users lose interest in the subject matter. However, there were several important practices to boost a form’s effectiveness that I found to be helpful. </p>

                    <p>First, minimizing input fields allows for prevention of cognitive overload.  This means ensuring that only relevant information is asked for, which helps the user complete the form quicker.  Second, the practice of chunking, also known as “grouping” in gestalt theory, increases the likelihood of the user completing the form.  Third, adding small details for information can be helpful.  For example, this could mean adding an asterisk for required fields or including a list of formatting requirements.  I realize by adding small details that provide some context of what you want the users to input, you can increase the speed that the user fills out the form.  Fourth, user feedback is a great way to address or confirm the user’s actions.  Fifth, it is important to pay attention to usability such as color contrast.  To take into consideration those who may be visually impaired, it is important for the form to not rely on color.
                    </p>

                    <p>Reading the article about best practices for form design made me realize the importance of clarity, directness, attention to detail, and user feedback.  Creating an effective form with good UX helps minimize user frustration and maximize user engagement.  I think it’s important to put yourself in the user’s shoes and approach form-design as an art for designing for accessibility as well as for people who are on a tight schedule.</p>
