                <p>The key to an engaging photo is detail that stimulates people to think about the photo’s intention.  In the article “10 Intriguing Photos to Teach Close Reading and Visual Thinking Skills,” Gonchar writes about ideas from students and teachers who have practiced visual thinking skills from looking at pictures.  Ideas include being detectives, practicing regularly, asking open ended questions, noticing details, building on others’ observations, adapting questions for all subjects, expanding worldly knowledge, starting conversations, introducing new ideas, and experimenting with ways to look closely.</p>

                <p>The key takeaway is that photos should make viewers question what was the message of the photo. I also believe that photos that stimulate feelings in the viewers are what make photos memorable and special.</p>

                <p>One website I found that looked particularly interesting was OTOFILM by we3studio.  The production studio’s website features a homepage full of cinematic advertisement campaign videos for different brands.  The website features a scroll and expand function where the viewer sees part of an image and can click and expand into the image.  Each time the user scrolls, you get introduced to a new topic.  I found this website to be very engaging and quite beautiful to scroll through.  All the elements are so cleverly placed, and I like how the text smoothly transitions from one idea into the next.</p>

                <div id="photo">

                    <p>Utilizing modals, overlays, and dialogue windows in a user interface is a science that must be perfected to satisfy its intended purpose. Modals are effective choices for grabbing the user’s attention, requesting user input such as signing in or logging in, showing additional contextual information, and showing additional non-contextual information.
                    </p>

                    <p>I thought it was interesting how the article talked about how modals can both help and hurt its intended purpose depending on how well they are designed to be executed. 
                    </p>

                    <p>One valuable practice that I read was that pop-ups should always be user-initiated, meaning the user should be the one who controls or triggers the response.  Pop-ups that suddenly appear can cause stress and result in the user quickly dismissing it.  Another valuable practice is that it is important to have an “escape hatch” that allows the user to exit out of the pop-up as well as buttons with understandable names that indicate action items.  
                    </p>

                    <p>I think that these design choices all fall in line with the theme that it is important that the users feel like they are in control at all times. Designing effective modals requires further thought about how users will respond to them. This requires skill in developing user empathy.

                <time datetime="2024-1-24">January 24, 2024</time>

                <div id="photo">

                <div class="entry">
                    <p>UX has the ability to affect the overall usability of a form.  I realize that filling out forms can often be quite draining and make users lose interest in the subject matter. However, there were several important practices to boost a form’s effectiveness that I found to be helpful. </p>

                    <p>First, minimizing input fields allows for prevention of cognitive overload.  This means ensuring that only relevant information is asked for, which helps the user complete the form quicker.  Second, the practice of chunking, also known as “grouping” in gestalt theory, increases the likelihood of the user completing the form.  Third, adding small details for information can be helpful.  For example, this could mean adding an asterisk for required fields or including a list of formatting requirements.  I realize by adding small details that provide some context of what you want the users to input, you can increase the speed that the user fills out the form.  Fourth, user feedback is a great way to address or confirm the user’s actions.  Fifth, it is important to pay attention to usability such as color contrast.  To take into consideration those who may be visually impaired, it is important for the form to not rely on color.
                    </p>

                    <p>Reading the article about best practices for form design made me realize the importance of clarity, directness, attention to detail, and user feedback.  Creating an effective form with good UX helps minimize user frustration and maximize user engagement.  I think it’s important to put yourself in the user’s shoes and approach form-design as an art for designing for accessibility as well as for people who are on a tight schedule.</p>
