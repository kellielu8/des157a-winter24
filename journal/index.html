                    <p>Utilizing modals, overlays, and dialogue windows in a user interface is a science that must be perfected to satisfy its intended purpose. Modals are effective choices for grabbing the user’s attention, requesting user input such as signing in or logging in, showing additional contextual information, and showing additional non-contextual information.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I thought it was interesting how the article talked about how modals can both help and hurt its intended purpose depending on how well they are designed to be executed. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        One valuable practice that I read was that pop-ups should always be user-initiated, meaning the user should be the one who controls or triggers the response.  Pop-ups that suddenly appear can cause stress and result in the user quickly dismissing it.  Another valuable practice is that it is important to have an “escape hatch” that allows the user to exit out of the pop-up as well as buttons with understandable names that indicate action items.  
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I think that these design choices all fall in line with the theme that it is important that the users feel like they are in control at all times.

                <time datetime="2024-1-24">January 24, 2024</time>

                <div id="photo">

                <div class="entry">
                    <p>UX has the ability to affect the overall usability of a form.  I realize that filling out forms can often be quite draining and make users lose interest in the subject matter. However, there were several important practices to boost a form’s effectiveness that I found to be helpful. </p>

                    <p>First, minimizing input fields allows for prevention of cognitive overload.  This means ensuring that only relevant information is asked for, which helps the user complete the form quicker.  Second, the practice of chunking, also known as “grouping” in gestalt theory, increases the likelihood of the user completing the form.  Third, adding small details for information can be helpful.  For example, this could mean adding an asterisk for required fields or including a list of formatting requirements.  I realize by adding small details that provide some context of what you want the users to input, you can increase the speed that the user fills out the form.  Fourth, user feedback is a great way to address or confirm the user’s actions.  Fifth, it is important to pay attention to usability such as color contrast.  To take into consideration those who may be visually impaired, it is important for the form to not rely on color.
                    </p>

                    <p>Reading the article about best practices for form design made me realize the importance of clarity, directness, attention to detail, and user feedback.  Creating an effective form with good UX helps minimize user frustration and maximize user engagement.  I think it’s important to put yourself in the user’s shoes and approach form-design as an art for designing for accessibility as well as for people who are on a tight schedule.</p>
